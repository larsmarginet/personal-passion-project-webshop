# personal-passion-project
This repository is part of the platform I'm building to enhance live concert experiences. The platform consists out of three parts: a part for the band, for the venue and for the people going to the concert. this repository will be about the last group. For performance reasons I'm keeping this webshop seperated of the venue and band platform. The latter will also be hosted on a subdomain.
